No you do not need have Zookeeper or Solr.Net library with this.
it does not support fail over to next solr server in zookeeper list.

## Transform data from solr to object 
The solrHttpClient will return all data as string as it revcived it.
No helper exists yet to transform it to you own data struct.
in futuer it will be a helper with that maybe the client will accpect you model and transform it to a object

##example to use it 
using Solr;
using Solr.SolrConfig;

function myconnection() {
  Solr.SolrConfig.Config cfg = new Solr.SolrConfig.Config cfg();
  cfg.solrCore = new Solr.SolrConfig.CoreConfig[1];
  cfg.solrCore[0].coreName = "my core / collection / share name";
  cfg.solrServerUrl = "http://localhost:8983";
  cfg.solrUserName = "http basic authorizing name";
  cfg.solrPassword = "http basic authorizing password clear text";
  cfg.solrUseBaiscAuth = true;
  
  SolrHTTPClient solr = SolrHTTPClient(cfg);
  
  string docs = solr.Select(0,"q=*%3A*",null);
 }
as you can see you must self encode the parms correct solr does not under stand + as space (%20) the parm need be encode correct
to encode the q=*:* cars" correct you need use str = "q="+Uri.EscapeDataString("*:* cars"); now you got corret url encoding
